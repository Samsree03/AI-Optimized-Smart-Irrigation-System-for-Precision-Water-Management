## Introduction:
In this project, we present an innovative solution for efficient crop irrigation, introducing an automated smart micro-irrigation system powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) with humidity stabilization. The core components of the system include a Data Collection Module and a Decision Taking Module, where the Node MCU ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi play pivotal roles.

## Data Collection Module:
The Data Collection Module, centered around the Node MCU ESP8266, is responsible for real-time sensory data collection. This involves connecting various sensors and actuators to the Node MCU, which then transmits the collected data to ThingSpeak, a cloud platform powered by MATLAB, using Wi-Fi. The unique WRITE API key facilitates secure and real-time data transmission.

## Decision Taking Module:
The Decision Taking Module, housed on a Raspberry Pi, serves as an embedded system where a machine learning model is deployed. This model processes the structured data received from ThingSpeak, making informed decisions on whether to initiate the irrigation process. The decisions are then back-propagated to the Node MCU via a separate channel on ThingSpeak.

## Implementation:
Implementation involves the wiring and integration of sensors to the Node MCU, setting up the cloud platform (ThingSpeak and MATLAB), and deploying the machine learning model on the Raspberry Pi. The successful integration of these elements forms the backbone of the system, allowing for effective data collection, analysis, and decision-making in irrigation.
Furthermore, this project contributes to the open-source community by generating a dataset on smart irrigation. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for those interested in exploring the practical applications of IoT and machine learning in agriculture.

## Results and Benefits:
The results and benefits of this system are evident in its ability to optimize water usage and improve crop output. The intelligent control of the irrigation process through the interaction between the Data Collection and Decision-making modules showcases the potential impact of this technology on modern agriculture.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project represents a successful integration of Node MCU ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi, demonstrating the practical application of IoT and machine learning in agriculture. The comprehensive overview provided here serves as a valuable resource for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in sustainable agricultural technologies.
